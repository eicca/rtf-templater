# RtfTemplater

This is a very simple gem designed to generate RTF documents from a given template.

This gem is written in haste, but it works in most cases (I tested it on mac office, and TextEdit).

It is heavily inspired by [Serenity](https://github.com/kremso/serenity).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rtf-templater'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rtf-templater

## Usage

Look at the example in the showcase directory.

In short this template:

![template](http://github.com/eicca/rtf-templater/blob/master/showcase/template.png?raw=true)

Generates such document:

![document](http://github.com/eicca/rtf-templater/blob/master/showcase/document.png?raw=true)
